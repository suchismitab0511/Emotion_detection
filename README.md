Emotion Detection Using CNN and FER-2013

🚀 Emotion Detection (April 2025)
Deep Learning project built with Python, TensorFlow, Keras, VGG16, ResNet50v2, OpenCV, and Gradio.

This project trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the FER-2013 dataset to classify 7 human emotions and deploys a real-time emotion recognition system using OpenCV and Gradio.

✨ Features

📊 CNN Model trained on FER-2013 with data augmentation, dropout, and class weighting.

🎯 Achieved 66% validation accuracy.

🖼️ Supports 7 emotions: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, Neutral.
